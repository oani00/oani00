Hi! I'm Oani (you can pronounce it like "1e")

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on things to increment my github.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things, in fact my "schedulle" is web in general (and computer neworks), JS, some JS frameworks, JAVA and C#. Maybe some basic Python in between to solve some URI problems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about games, I love videogames.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://linktr.ee/oanic <- Linkedin included
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the card game Magic the Gathering is turing complete?
